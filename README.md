PHP Assignment 1
The website has input fields that ask the user for your favourite video game title, the console it
is made for, and the ESRB rating that corrilates to the game you inputted. The title for the game must
not be left empty and must not exceed 100 characters or else it will reload your form page. The title 
input is a text field while the console and  rating fields are dropdowns that the options get pulled
from 2 different tables in my database. Once you hit the save button, your inputs will be inserted into a master
table from a third table in my database and will display the whole table onto a different page.
